Firebase States for OLED Screen Acknowledgements

These notes describe how Firebase states can be used to display acknowledgements on an OLED screen for real-time feedback.

General Approach:

* Firebase stores a state value.
* Events update this value in Firebase.
* NodeMCU monitors the Firebase value.
* NodeMCU updates the OLED screen based on the value.

State Mapping:

|   | Firebase Value | OLED Screen Display | Event Trigges | 1 | Image: Doorbell | Doorbell button pressed | ion. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2 | Text:  Door Open| | Door sensor detects ois open. |
| 3 | Image: Fire Alarm | Fire alarm sensor tmessage. |
| 0 | Image: Default/Home Screen | System idle/no acti,etected |

Technical Considerations:

* Fireb Configure Firebase.onfigured.
* Nod needs to:
    * Connect to Wi-Fi.
    * Authenticate with Firebase.
    * Listen for changes to the specified Firebase database path.
    * Update the OLED screen based on the received value.
* Real-time Updates: Firebase Realtime Database is ideal for this application due to its real-time capabilities. Firestore can also be used, but you'll need to listen for changes.
* OLED Display: Choose an appropriate OLED display and library for the NodeMCU.
* Error Handling: Implement error handling in the NodeMCU code to handle potential issues like Wi-Fi disconnections or Firebase errors.
* Scalability: Consider how this system will scale if you add more sensors or events. You might need to adjust the state mapping or database structure.
